- **Food Analysis** — Snap or search any food item and Seek analyses its nutritional content. Based on your health profile, allergies and goals, it tells you whether that food works for you and why — not just generic nutrition facts, but advice tailored to you.

- **Drug Verification** - Before taking any medication, run it through Seek. It checks the drug against your health history, family conditions and known allergies to flag any potential risks. Not a prescription — just a smart second opinion before you swallow something.

- **AI Health Chat** - Ask Seek anything health related and get answers that actually consider who you are. Powered by Google Gemini, the chat knows your diet type, health goals, allergies and history — so the advice it gives is personalised, not copy-pasted from a generic article.

- **WhatsApp Bot** - You don't need to open an app. Just message Seek on WhatsApp like you would a friend. Ask about a drug, a food, a symptom — get an instant AI response right in your chat. Your full conversation history is always saved and accessible via your personal link.

- **Family Health Profile** - Add your family members and their medical conditions, allergies and history. Seek uses this to factor in hereditary risks when giving you recommendations — because your family's health history is part of your health story too.

- **Health Dashboard** - A central view of everything Seek knows about you. Your recommendations, food analyses, drug checks and health insights all in one place so you can track your preventive health journey over time.

- **Chat History** - Every conversation you have with the Seek WhatsApp bot is stored securely and tied to your account. Access your full history anytime via your personal link — so nothing gets lost between sessions.
